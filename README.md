Minori
==============

Minori is an Android app that allows you to follow releases on a certain cat site.  
It can be paired with any torrent app that can watch a directory for a full automation.

Note about Core classes
------
Improvement is much needed on the Core package that retrieves data from HummingBird, Nyaa, and MAL (in the future).
The classes under this package will be moved to its own GitHub repo in the future upon meeting a satisfactory library standard.

Building
------
Clone the repo via Git and build in Android Studio.

OR 

Just use the "Checkout project from Version Control" option when starting Android Studio and in the Vcs Repository Url section, insert the URL:

https://github.com/nizlumina/Minori.git

and build.
